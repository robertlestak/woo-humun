# woo-humun

Start selling your digital creations through WooCommerce and humun quickly.

## Getting Started

Install the woo-humun plugin into your WordPress site. You will notice a new `humun` tab has been added to your admin menu.

In the `humun` admin section, enter your humun tenant ID to save it in your WordPress. You will see all of your current humun digital assets, and you can link them to your WooCommerce products.

Before you start selling, you will need to link your WooCommerce site to humun. This allows humun to validate payments have been completed before finalizing and distributing your digital assets.

To link your WordPress, click the "Connect to humun" button at the top of the humun admin page in your WordPress. If at any time you reinstall your wordpress, you can always re-link with humun through this portal.
